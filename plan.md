## **Marketing Strategy for First 100 Listings**

**Phase 1: Direct Outreach (Weeks 1-4)**

1. **Hit LinkedIn hard** - Search for "UK sponsor licence" or check the gov.uk sponsor list, find recruiters/HR at those companies
2. **Cold email template**: "We noticed [Company] is on the UK sponsor list. We're launching ukvisasponsorship.com - the ONLY job board where candidates know 100% you sponsor visas. First 20 companies post free for 90 days."
3. Target industries desperate for visa workers: tech, healthcare, engineering, hospitality
4. **Specific companies to target first**: Big consultancies (Deloitte, Accenture, PwC), tech companies, NHS trusts, universities

**Phase 2: Content + Community (Weeks 2-8)**

1. **SEO content**: "Companies hiring with UK visa sponsorship 2025", "Tier 2 visa sponsor jobs", "[Job title] visa sponsorship UK"
2. **Reddit**: r/ukvisa, r/IWantOut - become the helpful expert, link when relevant
3. **Facebook groups**: UK visa, expat groups - don't spam, genuinely help people
4. **Twitter**: Share weekly "companies actively hiring visa workers" threads

**Phase 3: Candidate Side (Concurrent)**

1. **You need job seekers to attract employers** - start posting jobs yourself from company websites (credit them properly)
2. Email companies: "We've already listed your job and sent 50 qualified candidates your way - want to claim your free company page?"
3. **International job seeker groups** are MASSIVE - target students finishing UK degrees, people in India/Nigeria/Pakistan wanting UK jobs

**Phase 4: PR & Credibility**

1. **Press release**: "New platform solves visa sponsorship job search problem" - send to TechCrunch, Immigration advice blogs
2. Get featured on immigration lawyer sites, visa consultant blogs
3. **Data play**: "We analyzed 10,000 sponsor license holders - here's which industries hire most" (creates backlinks)

## **The Critical First 90 Days**

**Chicken-and-egg problem solver:**

- **Week 1-2**: Manually add 50-100 jobs from sponsor companies' websites (they're public!) - gives you inventory
- **Week 2-4**: Email those companies: "We listed your jobs free - claim your page and get analytics"
- **Week 3-6**: Target **recruitment agencies** on the sponsor list - they'll want to post multiple jobs, easier to convert
- **Month 2-3**: Once you have 200+ listings, candidates come organically via SEO

**Free trial strategy that works:**

- "First month free, no credit card required" beats everything
- After they see the quality of applications, they'll pay

**Partnership gold mine:**

- Immigration lawyers and visa consultants - they want to help their clients find jobs
- University career services - international students need this
- Tech bootcamps - career switchers often need sponsorship

Your niche is **extremely** valuable - people searching for visa sponsorship jobs are highly motivated. Start scrappy, prove the concept works with 20 paying customers, then scale.
